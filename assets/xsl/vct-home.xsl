				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					This is an open and free video chat.
					It is based on the W3C standards
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/">Server-Sent Events</a>,
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC</a>, and 
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/">Media Capture and Streams</a>
					to provide a quick, easy-to-use stream transmission... thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our server stores the metadata needed for browsers to start communicating, but after that nothing else gets sent to it.
					The actual audio/video streams are transmitted peer-to-peer, with no server in between, so none of those are stored (or even processed) anywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					To start, press "Create New Room" below, then share the URL you land in with any peeps you want to talk to.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's probably lots of bugs, so handle with care.

				<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
				<p>
					Because we here at Slothsoft are all awkward penguins, the Video Chat Thing won't start sending streams out on its own.
					To initiate a video chat with someone else, each of you will have to click on <button>ðŸ“¤</button> to start sending out your own respective webcam feeds.
